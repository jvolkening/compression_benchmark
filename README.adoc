= Optimal compression scheme to balance ratio and decompression speed

.Abstract
Some resources spent most of their time in storage but also require quick access when needed.
For these resources, compression speed is of little importance, as they are write-once-read-often objects.
We tested a number of popular compression tools to look for one which provided fast decompression with reasonable file sizes.

== Methods

Three input files were used for testing, each truncated to ~ 2GB in size:

f1.input:: A file of randomly chosen English words

f2.input:: The *Mus musculus* genome

f3.input:: A prebuilt https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/centrifuge/[Centrifuge] index file

Tests were run using AWS Batch, with one or four threads per process.
For all programs, default parameters were used except for compression level and threads, which were set as indicated below.
