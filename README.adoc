.Abstract
Some resources spent most of their time in storage but also require quick access when needed.
For these resources, compression speed is of little importance, as they are write-once-read-often objects.
We tested a number of popular compression tools to look for one which provided fast decompression with reasonable file sizes.

The follow results were derived using eight cores of a 64-core, 512GB RAM Xeon-based server.
